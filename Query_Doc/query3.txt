Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices?

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in
timing, but drastically reduces the image-preparation time, no?

Of course, I do not agree.  It does have more horsepower.  Horsepower is not
the only measurement for 'better'.  It does not have full motion, full screen
video yet.  Does it have CD-ROM XA?

This is second hand, but it still hard to look to the future ;-).
