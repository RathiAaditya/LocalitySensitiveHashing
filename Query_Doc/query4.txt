But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.
Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.
Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.
Good luck....

I'm sorry, but as of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there is no information available on the architecture or release of GPT-4. At the moment, GPT-3 remains the latest and most advanced language model developed by OpenAI.
However, based on previous advancements and improvements made in each iteration of GPT models, it can be speculated that GPT-4 would likely be an even more powerful language model with a larger training dataset, improved training techniques, and potentially new architectural features.
It's important to keep in mind that developing a new language model like GPT-4 can take a significant amount of time and resources
